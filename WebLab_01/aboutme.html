	<h3><a name = "introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
		<p>
		Most tags have an opening and closing that dictates the boundaries of a web object. The closing tag will include a forward slash. The head includes information not seen by the site user, such as the website title. The body includes the site content, such as images and text.<hr/>
		</p>
	<h3><a name = "paragraphs"></a>Paragraph Text</h3>
		<p>
		Use the tags &ltp> and &lt/p> to denote text to be in paragraph form. &ltbr/> will add line break, making it an alternative to paragraph tags. These have to be used as html is not senstive to blank spaces. &lthr/> will add a horizontal line to act as a separator. &ltstrong> bolds text and &ltem> italicizes it. All of these tags can be used to separate text, making the page more visually appealing to users.<hr/>
		</p>
	<h3><a name = "links"></a>Adding Links</h3>
		<p>
		Use &lt!-- and --> to add comments, which has the same effect as # in python. This allows the creators to organize the site's code. The anchor tag, &lta> and &lt/a> is used to reference outside sources, such as links, photos, or specific parts of a page.<hr/> 
		</p>
	<h3><a name = "navigation"></a>Page Navigation</h3>
		<p>
		Use &lth1> to &lth6> to change the font size for headers, with &lth6> being the largest. By naming specific parts of a page using name = and the anchor tag, those parts can be individually linked using href = and the anchor tag. This is the same technique wikipedia uses to help users navigate a page.<hr/> 
		</p>
	<h3><a name = "images"></a>Adding Images</h3>
		<p>
		Title = can be used in addition to a link as a tool tip. When users hover over the link, they will see the tool tip and know what the link leads to. Images are added using &img>. Src = will link the specific image and height = or width = can be used to control size. However using both can distort the image.
