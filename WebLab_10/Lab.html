				<h1>Kathy</h1>
				<h2>a.k.a. Kathmandu</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Kathy has got her life together; she's the dad. She's taking the hardest courses and gets A's with the most ease. Also, she got a 36 on the ACT, so she's obviously magical. She's a tennis superstar and overall responsible person. She's got giant eyes (defying Asian stereotypes) and a strange obsession with Watsky.</p>

				<h1>Jocelyn</h1>
				<h2>a.k.a. Joss Boss</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Jocelyn is my fellow procrastinator. She's super full of energy and talks all the time. She's got all dem boys and an unnecessary amount of drama. Her teacher's love her, especially Mrs. Moffett. She's also the only one with a fashion sense. She takes way too long to eat.</p>
