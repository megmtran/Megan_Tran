				<h1>Kathy</h1>
			</header>
			<p>Kathy has got her life together; she's the dad. She's taking the hardest courses and gets A's with the most ease. Also, she got a 36 on the ACT, so she's obviously magical. She's a tennis superstar and overall responsible person. She's got giant eyes (defying Asian stereotypes) and a strange obsession with Watsky.</p>
